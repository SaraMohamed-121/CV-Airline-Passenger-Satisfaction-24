# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

Welcome to **Assignment 1** for the Computer Vision Summer Training hosted by APPLiAi!

## Description

In this assignment, you will demonstrate your skills in **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** by working on a dataset related to an airline passenger satisfaction survey. Your task is to develop an ANN model that predicts whether a passenger is satisfied based on various attributes.

### Objectives:
- **Explore the dataset:** Analyze the features provided in the airline passenger satisfaction survey.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data for optimal performance.
- **Develop an ANN Model:** Build and train an ANN model to classify passenger satisfaction.
- **Predict Passenger Satisfaction:** Use the model to predict satisfaction levels, helping improve airline service strategies.

We wish you the best of luck! May your efforts lead to innovative solutions and remarkable achievements.
